# Method for Bypassing FACEBOOK Moderation via Language Launch 🔥

We'll tell you about a method for passing ad moderation on Facebook that allows you to push through unwanted creatives. The method leverages the nuances of multilingual creative processing, reducing the chance of ad rejection.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** Everything we show is for educational purposes only. This method does not guarantee 100% approval of "black creatives," but it significantly increases your chances. The current market and auction situation play a huge role in this process—sometimes you can promote prohibited creatives without issues, and sometimes everything gets blocked in a row; this is called a FB storm.

In addition to this method, we also recommend:
- Using agency accounts.
- Scheduling the launch (of ad sets) for the start of the new day according to the account's time zone.
- Selecting the country you need to target + the Antarctica geo.
- During periods with many Rejections, if you are using many duplicate ads, you should uniqueize the ad creative (make minimal changes, update metadata, etc.).

## Step 1: Set Your GEO Targeting

Select your desired geographic location in the targeting settings.

## Step 3: Add “White” creatives to your ads

Prepare in advance a white image of some product (for example, a photo of clothing) and an ad description. Ideally, the text should be localized for the selected language.

## Step 5: Configure Language Strategy

If your task is to promote a video creative, then for non-target languages we add a video; if you are working with static creatives, for target languages we also choose static images.

**Video Creative Settings:**

1. It is mandatory that the length of the main video (your "black" creative) does not exceed 30 seconds.
2. Additionally, append 14-15 minutes of a "white" video or a static white image to the end of the main video.
3. Apply 5-7% noise.
4. Add a slight blur of 7-8%.

**Primary Language:**  
Choose a non-target language (e.g., African, Arabic, etc.)

**Additional Language:**  
Add German (or your target language) where you place your **"black creative".** If you have a video creative, you can add a preview for the video with an image of the white product.

**All Other Languages:**  
Upload your "white creative" (safe, non-triggering content).

If your creative still gets rejected during moderation, try generating the main ad text (for the offer) using GPT. Make it 4000-5000 characters long; it can be a first-person story describing a casino experience. The text must be relevant to the offer topic.

## How It Works

The moderation system sees multiple "white creatives" across different languages, while your "black creative" is hidden among them. This disperses the moderation focus and increases approval chances.
